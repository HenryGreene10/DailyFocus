# AGENTS

## Required workflow
- Always read `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and `docs/plans/CURRENT.md` before making changes.
- Keep diffs small and shippable.
- Update ticket status in `docs/plans/CURRENT.md` as work is completed.
- Ensure the app can run with `npx expo start` before final handoff.
- Commit locally after each major step. Do not push.

## Guardrails
- Work only inside `focus-trainer/`.
- Default to the simplest implementation that satisfies M0 product rules.
- If blocked, document the blocker and leave minimal TODO notes.
